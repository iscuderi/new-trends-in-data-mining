The objective of the present work is to analyze the dataset "Crime Data from 2020 to Present" (download available at: 
https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8), using subgroup discovery techniques. 
The dataset to be studied reflects crime incidents in the city of Los Angeles from 2020 to present. 
These data are transcribed from original crime reports that are written on paper and, therefore, there may be some inaccuracies in the data. 
Some location fields with missing data are noted as (0°, 0°). Address fields are only provided to the nearest hundred blocks to maintain privacy.
